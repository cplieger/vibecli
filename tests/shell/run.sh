#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs every entrypoint.sh unit test in this directory.
#
# This filename is the contract: cplieger/ci's shell-ci.yaml runs
# `tests/shell/run.sh` when it exists, and skips otherwise, so a repo opts into
# shell unit testing by committing this file. Keep the name.
#
# The hook tests -f and invokes this through `bash`, so the exec bit is not
# load-bearing (it was committed 100644 once, which under an -x check would have
# skipped the whole suite silently and still reported CI green). The bit is set
# anyway, for anyone running it directly.
#
# WHAT THIS REPO'S SUITE COVERS. This file is repo-owned (lib.sh and
# harness_test.sh beside it are synced from cplieger/ci), so the per-repo scope
# rationale lives here.
#
# entrypoint.sh IS the product's boot path, and its most consequential
# branches are the ones that fail CLOSED — a non-private /config, an
# unowned PATH segment that resists hardening, a package index that cannot be
# read — and a smoke test can never reach them, because a healthy image never
# takes them. tests/image-smoke.sh builds an image and asserts it boots; these
# assert what happens when it should NOT.
#
# The kiro-cli INSTALL is no longer part of that surface: the Go server owns it
# (the cplieger/pinstall library), so its failure branches are that library's own
# Go tests. What stays here is
# what the entrypoint still does — directory hardening, the KAS runtime prune,
# and the legacy tool-metadata notice.
#
# Each *_test.sh is a separate process, so one test's stubs, traps and shell
# options cannot leak into another's. All of them run even when an early one
# fails: a boot path's tests are cheap, and a maintainer wants the whole picture
# from one CI log rather than one failure at a time.
